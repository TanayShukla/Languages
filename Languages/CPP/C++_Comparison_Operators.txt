C++ Comparison Operators
Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

Note: The return value of a comparison is either true (1) or false (0).

In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

Example
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
cout << (x > y); // returns 1 (true) because 5 is greater than 3
A list of all comparison operators:

Operator	Name	Example	Try it
==	Equal to	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	
You will learn much more about comparison operators and how to use them in a later chapter.
