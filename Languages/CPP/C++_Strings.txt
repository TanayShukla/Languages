C++ Strings
C++ Strings
Strings are used for storing text.

A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:

Example
Create a variable of type string and assign it a value:

string greeting = "Hello";
To use strings, you must include an additional header file in the source code, the <string> library:

Example
// Include the string library
#include <string>

// Create a string variable
string greeting = "Hello";
