C++ Identifiers
All C++ variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

Example
// Good
int minutesPerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
int m = 60;
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names
