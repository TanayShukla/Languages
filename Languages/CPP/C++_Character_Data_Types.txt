Character Types
The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

Example
char myGrade = 'B';
cout << myGrade;
Alternatively, you can use ASCII values to display certain characters:

Example
char a = 65, b = 66, c = 67;
cout << a;
cout << b;
cout << c;
Tip: A list of all ASCII values can be found in our ASCII Table Reference.
