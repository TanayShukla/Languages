String Types
The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). This is not a built-in type, but it behaves like one in its most basic usage. String values must be surrounded by double quotes:

Example
string greeting = "Hello";
cout << greeting;
To use strings, you must include an additional header file in the source code, the <string> library:

Example
// Include the string library
#include <string>

// Create a string variable
string greeting = "Hello";

// Output string value
cout << greeting;
