C++ While Loop
C++ Loops
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

C++ While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:

Example
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;
}
Note: Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!
