C++ Access Strings
Access Strings
You can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [].

This example prints the first character in myString:

Example
string myString = "Hello";
cout << myString[0];
// Outputs H
Note: String indexes start with 0: [0] is the first character. [1] is the second character, etc.

This example prints the second character in myString:

Example
string myString = "Hello";
cout << myString[1];
// Outputs e
Change String Characters
To change the value of a specific character in a string, refer to the index number, and use single quotes:

Example
string myString = "Hello";
myString[0] = 'J';
cout << myString;
// Outputs Jello instead of Hello
